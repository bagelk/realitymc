# If you wish to disable a rune, remove the # before its name.
# This is the name printed when the rune is activated.
# List the name of a player to ban them from using magic (except existing teleporters).
# 
# Here are some extra options you can add to the list:
# Enable Black Magic, allows True Name skulls to be worn as helms allowing players to cast magic as if they were the true name owners
# Consume Dragon Eggs # by default dragon eggs are not consumed when runes use them
# Enable Travel Ink force teleporters and waypoints to be made of a specific material
# ink X # dermine the block type (X) to use for travel ink-- you must add this if you add the above
# disable multiworld travel Disables teleportation between worlds.
# Signature assignmentsm, this enables reserving Waypoints/Freight signature.
# You can have a block id followed by : and a metadata if you wish to specify that:
# You can also have a wildcard(*) to represent any block:
# Here is an example.:
# Signature Assignments
#     player name, north, east, south, west (This line must start with 1 or more spaces)
#     Amuxix, 35:5, 57, *, * 
# This would reserve all signature with green wool north, diamond block east and any block on south and west
# These all stack, allowing multiple signature groups per person.
# 
# Enable World Groups # Enables the restriction of TPs/FTPs/Zeerix Chest to only travel inside that group.
# Define the group like this, based on world folder name.
# WorldGroup world, world_nether, world_the_end
# WorldGroup creative, creative_2 
# With this enabled, worlds ungrouped will be freely accessible by other ungrouped worlds. 
# 
# use MultiGroupInk # To define teleport/FTP/etc inks that can escape world groups 
# MultiGroupInk 57 (would allow diamond runes to travel freely) 
# MultiGroupInk 7 (would allow bedrock runes to travel freely) 
# use MultiGroupRune to define teleport/FTP/etc runes can escape world groups 
# MultiGroupRune recall (would allow recall rune to travel freely between grouped worlds) 
#
